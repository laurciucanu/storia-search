Hello,

This is a web straper for a real-estate agency called Storia. You can use it by updated the START_URL with the town, build year, number of the rooms etc. 

In order for this scrip to run you need to install all of the needed Python packages with:  ``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```

The script will go to the number of pages that you mention in the for loop. I also set a max price of 160000 euro as an example. You can update it as you like.

I hope this script you help you!
